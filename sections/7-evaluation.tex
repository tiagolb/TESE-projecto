\section{Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

%Explain how you are going to show your results (statistical data, cpu performance etc). Answer the following questions:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Why is this solution going to be better than others.
%  \item How am I going to defend that it is better.
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implementation:}\emph{TrubiZone} will run along side Android and will be implemented upon a Freescale i.MX53 Quick Start Board development board~\footnote{http://www.freescale.com/products/arm-processors/i.mx-applications-processors-based-on-arm-cores/i.mx53-processors/i.mx53-quick-start-board:IMX53QSB}, which supports ARM's TrustZone. To illustrate \emph{TrubiZone}'s functionality a Personal Health Record management mobile application will be implemented. This applications allows a user to display, store and edit his personal health information securely, without this sensitive information ever being exposed to a untrusted rich OS such as Android.
% ESTA FRASE QUE SE SEGUE NA ARQUITECTURA?
To allow for a more flexible development environment using TrubiZone, we expect to support sensitive applications built using GlobalPlatform's API.

% DIZER QUE COMO IMX53 NAO APRESENTA NMI (INTERRUPTS SEGUROS) TEM QUE SE FAZER O QUE EST√Å NO PAPER DO TRUSTOTP

% TALVEZ OLHAR PARA O PAPER DO TRUSTOTP TBM PARA VER COISAS SOBRE AS DRIVERS E FRAMEBUFFERS

\paragraph{Evaluation:}To evaluate \emph{TrubiZone} we measure the performance overhead for displaying, storing and editing sensitive files as well as compare the development process for the PHR mHealth app using TrubiZone and a similar app built on top of Android. The performance can be measured by using the performance monitor available in the Cortex-A8 processor to count the CPU cycles and then convert the cycles to time by multiplying 1 \emph{ns / cycle}. By conducting each experiment for each of the use cases described several times and averaging the value we can compare this value taken for \emph{TrubiZone} with the value measured in the same conditions for a similar applications without using the secure system.

%For the power consumption measurements we may use Monsoon Power Monitor~\footnote{https://www.msoon.com/LabEquipment/PowerMonitor/} and compare the consumption of power when TrubiZone is running, when it is not running and when a similar application is running outside TrubiZone.


\section{Future Work Plan}
\label{sec:workplan}

Future work is scheduled as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item January 9 - March 25: Detailed design and implementation of the
	proposed architecture, including preliminary tests.
	\item March 26 - May 1: Perform the complete experimental evaluation
	of the results.
	\item May 2 - May 10: Write a paper describing the project.
	\item May 11 - June 15: Finish the writing of the dissertation.
	\item June 15: Deliver the MSc dissertation.
\end{itemize}
