\begin{abstract}

Mobile devices are growing and being adopted everywhere. Increasingly, such devices execute critical applications which require very sensitive data to be displayed on the devices' screen. Medical and financial records are examples of such sensitive data. However, in order to display sensitive information, applications currently depend on the code of all underlying layers, which comprise a full-blown operating system. Given that all these software layers result in a very large and complex computing base, it is difficult to ensure that the sensitive records displayed on screen have not been intercepted and leaked by a malicious agent that managed to compromise the operating system. The goal of this thesis is to design and implement a TrustZone-based solution that enables applications to securely output sensitive data without relying on a large rich OS. This report describes the state of the art and introduces a preliminary architecture of our solution: a software system named \emph{ViewZone}. To motivate and validate the concept of this solution, a critical mobile health application will be implemented.
