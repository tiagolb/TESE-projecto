With the ever-growing number of connected devices worldwide, and with a more conscious and sharing society, mobile devices are becoming interesting data banks. With such an impact in our lives, mobile developers must focus on developing secure and privacy aware applications to protect users and services. Today's mobile operating systems do not offer fully secure methods to support critical applications, such as e-Health, e-voting and e-money, by not taking advantage of secure hardware technology like TrustZone. This paper proposes a new model for the development of critical mobile applications and a system based on TrustZone implementing it.
